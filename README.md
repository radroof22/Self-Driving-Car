# Self-Driving-Car

## Overview
* This project was created using a Tensorflow LSTM which would recieve images from the client robot and make predicition for which turns it should make
* The pictures on the client were taken using OpenCV2 and would be sent over as raw pixels in the form of a real-time web socket
* The model learned to drive through a paper track on the ground and passed the statistical analysis proof
